As a Frontend Engineer at Gits Indonesia, I was tasked with building a complex, data-driven application for a logistics company. I developed a command center dashboard designed to manage and monitor various products. This project was built using Vue.js and TypeScript, requiring a strong focus on type-safety and creating a robust, scalable frontend architecture.
