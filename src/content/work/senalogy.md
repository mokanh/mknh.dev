As a Founding Full-Stack Engineer at Senalogy, I am taking on the challenge of building a critical platform from the ground up for the healthcare sector. My primary focus is on the development of a PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System), also known as a Radiology Information System (RIS). This system is essential for managing and interpreting medical imagery.

This role marks my first entry into the complex health industry, providing a fresh opportunity to learn and implement highly specialized protocols like DICOM. Using a modern stack of Node.js, React, and TypeScript, I am responsible for engineering both the frontend and backend components of this sophisticated medical application.
