In my role as a Frontend Engineer at Ordivo Teknologi Indonesia, I spent three and a half years building a sophisticated web application designed to solve logistics challenges for commerce businesses. We created a platform that functions as a central hub, aggregating numerous third-party courier services and integrating them into a single solution for online retailers.
