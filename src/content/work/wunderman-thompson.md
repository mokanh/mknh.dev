During my time at Wunderman Thompson, I was responsible for bridging the gap between design and technical implementation. My key task was to translate Figma designs into a fully functional and responsive web application using React.js. This product was built for a major insurance corporation, emphasizing the need for a polished, reliable, and user-friendly interface.
