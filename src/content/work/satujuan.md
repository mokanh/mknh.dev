My time at Satujuan/BlazBluz served as a foundational experience that launched my career in web development. In this start-up environment, I acquired a broad range of essential skills. I learned to work with jQuery and Laravel, build and consume RESTful APIs, and master version control systems. This role was also my first introduction to team collaboration and understanding corporate dynamics in a fast-paced setting.
