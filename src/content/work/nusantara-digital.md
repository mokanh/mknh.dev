As a Web Developer at Nusantara Digital, I built a strong foundation in professional web development by working on projects for various medium-to-high-level brands and companies. My core responsibility was translating static PSD designs into fully responsive HTML and CSS. This role was also my first introduction to more advanced technologies; I began working with the Laravel framework and started my journey with modern JavaScript frameworks by using Vue.js.
