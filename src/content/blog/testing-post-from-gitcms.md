That idea became GitCMS — a Chrome extension that turns any GitHub repo into a lightweight CMS. Just open your markdown, edit in a beautiful UI, commit, and boom — your content is live.

I use GitCMS to manage not just my personal blog, but also all my product websites — landing pages, changelogs, docs, everything. It keeps content simple and versioned in Git, while giving me a smooth Notion-like UI to work in. No bloated dashboards, no setting up databases, no self-hosted CMS headaches. Just Git + markdown + a clean writing experience that lets me focus on shipping and growing.
